- [ ] Environment variable fallback for options
- [ ] Subcommand support (e.g. `git commit`)
- [ ] Argument deprecation warnings
- [ ] Config file support (e.g. JSON, TOML)
- [ ] Argument count constraints (min/max for positionals)
- [ ] Hidden arguments (not shown in help)
- [ ] Custom validators for arguments
- [ ] Better help formatting (grouping, wrapping, usage examples)
- [ ] Shell completion script generation (bash, zsh, fish)
- [ ] Argument aliases (multiple names for the same flag/option)
- [ ] More advanced mutually exclusive/required group logic
